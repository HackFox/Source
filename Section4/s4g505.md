## HeaderHeight

This property specifies the height, in pixels, of a grid's column headers.

### Usage

```foxpro
grdGrid.HeaderHeight = nHeight
nHeight = grdGrid.HeaderHeight
```

Why "HeaderHeight" instead of just "Height?" At first, we felt that this was a slip-up by the development team, the anti-polymorphic urge to name every variable in an application differently. "This property really should be Height, just like in all the other objects," we thought. But look at its scope&mdash;HeaderHeight is defined at the Grid level of containership, not for each individual column, since all Headers must share the same height property, so it is HeaderHeight. We still feel that it is somehow "out of scope" and violating encapsulation for a header's property to be stored outside the object in its grid container, but headers, columns and grids share a special relationship&mdash;the contained objects, like goldfish in a bowl, can exist only inside the container, so this dependence, while not truly Pure Object Oriented Programming (POOP), works. 'Nuff said.

### Example

```foxpro
ThisForm.Grid1.HeaderHeight = 20
```
