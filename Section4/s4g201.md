## Set Border

This is yet another command that used to be useful but we can't imagine using today. SET BORDER determines the type of border that surrounds windows, popups and boxes that you create. Several of its options are ignored in Visual FoxPro, and there's not much reason to use the others.

### Usage

```foxpro
SET BORDER TO SINGLE | DOUBLE | PANEL | NONE
        | nBorderString1 [ , nBorderString2 ]
```
<table border cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=100%>
<tr>
  <td width=32% valign=top>
  <p><b>Parameter</b></p>
  </td>
  <td width=23% valign=top>
  <p><b>Value</b></p>
  </td>
  <td width=45% valign=top>
  <p><b>Meaning</b></p>
  </td>
 </tr>
<tr>
  <td width=32% valign=top>
  <p>nBorderString<i>n</i></p>
  </td>
  <td width=23% valign=top>
  <p>List of numbers</p>
  </td>
  <td width=45% valign=top>
  <p>A comma-delimited list of up to eight ASCII character values used to specify the various parts of the border. nBorderString2 applies only to inactive windows. Both border strings are ignored in Visual FoxPro.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

SINGLE provides a single border window, as you'd expect. Both DOUBLE and PANEL provide a half-size, panel-type border. NONE, not surprisingly, produces objects with no border. If you specify a border string, it's totally ignored and you get a single border anyway. Adding border characteristics such as GROW or MINIMIZE to the window definition forces the border back to the Windows look, while FLOAT or CLOSE forces the top border to show a control menu icon and/or close icon.

We don't create the kinds of objects that use the value of SET BORDER very much in Visual FoxPro.

### Example

```foxpro
SET BORDER TO PANEL
DEFINE WINDOW test FROM 10,10 TO 20,60
ACTIVATE WINDOW test
```
