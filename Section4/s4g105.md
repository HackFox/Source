## Row(), Col(), PRow(), PCol()

Back in FoxBase days, even early FoxPro days, we used these functions a lot. We can't remember the last time we used them, though. They return the cursor position on the screen and on the printer, respectively.

### Usage

```foxpro
nCurScreenRow = ROW()
nCurScreenCol = COL()
nCurPrintRow = PROW()
nCurPrintCol = PCOL()
```

You can substitute $ for either ROW() or COL() in @ .. GET and @ .. SAY commands to specify the current location. ROW() and COL() do not respect the settings of ScaleMode, always reporting the row and column coordinates in foxels.

### Example

```foxpro
@ROW(), COL()+1 SAY "Here's some information"
```
