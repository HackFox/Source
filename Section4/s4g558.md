## MaxLength

This property determines the maximum number of characters that can be entered in an edit box or text box.

### Usage

```foxpro
oObject.MaxLength = nMaxChars
nMaxChars = oObject.MaxLength
```

To let the user enter an unlimited number of characters, set MaxLength to 0. When MaxLength is non-zero, additional characters are thrown away. Be careful when you bind controls to fields. If MaxLength is less than the field length (or the current length of a memo field), if you change the data at all, the characters beyond MaxLength may be discarded.

In VFP 3, this property applied only to edit boxes. It was added to text boxes in VFP 5.

### Example

```foxpro
This.MaxLength = 400
```
