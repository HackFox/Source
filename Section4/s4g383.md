## ReadActivate, ReadDeactivate, ReadShow, ReadValid, ReadWhen

These formset events are descendants of the READ command's event-handling clauses, one event to a clause. They get populated when you apply Functional Conversion to a 2.x screen and fire at the appropriate times when you run the resulting formset.

These events fire only when WindowType is 2 or 3&mdash;the types reserved for READ compatibility. You have no reason to ever put code in one of these yourself.

Don't confuse ReadWhen and ReadValid with the useful, control-level When and Valid events. Note also that the ReadActivate, ReadDeactivate and ReadShow events don't replace the form and formset Activate, Deactivate and Show events. Those fire as well. The firing sequence is nicely documented in Help under the aptly named "Event Firing Sequence" in the "Overview of READ Compatibility Architecture."
