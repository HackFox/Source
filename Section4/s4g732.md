## BuildDateTime

This property of the Project object tells you when the project was last built. 

### Usage

```foxpro
tLastBuild = prjProject.BuildDateTime
```

BuildDateTime gives you a programmatic way to find out when a project was last built. It shows you the same information that's in the Project Info dialog for "Last Built:". The value returned is a datetime. If the project has never been built, you get the empty datetime (\{  / /     :  :  }).

### Example

```foxpro
IF TTOD(Application.ActiveProject.BuildDateTime) < DATE()
   WAIT WINDOW "Haven't built this project today" NOWAIT
ENDIF
```
