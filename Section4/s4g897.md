## Close

This method of the Project object (we just love to say "Project object") closes the Project Manager.

### Usage

```foxpro
prjProject.Close()
```

The COM Project object, added in VFP 6, provides programmatic control over projects and the Project Manager. The Close method makes it possible to shut down the Project Manager without resorting to KEYBOARDing the appropriate keystrokes.

When a project that has an associated project hook is closed, whether interactively or using the Close method, the Destroy event of the project hook fires.

### Example

```foxpro
_VFP.ActiveProject.Close()
```
