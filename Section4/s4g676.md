## Debug, Close Debugger

These two commands start up and shut down the VFP debugger, respectively. 

### Usage

```foxpro
DEBUG
CLOSE DEBUGGER
```

These commands are the easy part. Learning to use the debugger effectively takes much more effort. (See "Productive Debugging" in Section 2 for more on that subject.) When you've set the debugger to its own frame, issuing DEBUG is the same as choosing Debugger from the Tools menu. When the debugger is sharing the FoxPro frame, DEBUG opens the Trace and Watch windows. You have to open the others yourself, either from the menu or with ACTIVATE WINDOW commands. (Hint: the name for each window is the caption that it displays. For the debug output window, you need quotes: ACTI WIND "debug output".)

CLOSE DEBUGGER is a pretty smart bugger. It closes whichever debugger windows are open.

### Example

```foxpro
DEBUG
* Do some testing
CLOSE DEBUGGER
```
