MENU is one of a number of schemes created somewhere between the late Cretaceous and early Jurassic periods of Xbase. The fact that it is even supported at all in Visual FoxPro is a source of wonder to us, and a testament to the devotion Microsoft places on backward compatibility. But don't do that.

We put this section here just to tell you to use the Menu Designer. It can do all this command is capable of and more&mdash;like negotiating with OLE objects and browsers for menu placement, and pre- and post-generation processing by such cool utilities as GenMenuX. Use the Menu Designer instead.

### Usage

```foxpro
Don't. (Okay, see the reference manuals-for an
older version-if you must know. They look OK.)
```
