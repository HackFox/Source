## Set FullPath, Set("FullPath")

This setting determines whether a few functions return a complete path with their results or only the drive and file name. The function returns the current setting.

### Usage

```foxpro
SET FULLPATH ON | OFF
cOnOrOff = SET( "FULLPATH" )
```

This setting affects the various functions that return file names for open tables and databases. In addition to the ones listed in Help (DBF(), CDX(), MDX() and NDX()), it also applies to DBC().

We're mystified as to why anyone would ever want this turned off. What good does "F:CUSTOMER.DBF" do you? Guess you might parse the drive name off to get just the file name, but even that's no big deal anymore since JustDrive()'s been added to the language.

### Example

```foxpro
USE HOME()+"FoxUser" AGAIN
? DBF(1) && Returns something like G:\VFP 7\FOXUSER.DBF
SET FULLPATH OFF
? DBF(1) && Returns something like G:FOXUSER.DBF
```
