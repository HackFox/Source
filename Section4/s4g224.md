## Load, Call, Release Module

These are the commands to load, run and release BIN files, the oldest form of extension to the dBASE API, and remarkably, they are not supported in Visual FoxPro. They'll be missed, because there were some cool BIN files that could do neat things in 25 bytes, and they didn't suffer from the inconvenience of needing to be recompiled when each new version of FoxPro came along.

Issuing LOAD yields error 1001, "Feature is not available." The CALL command is ignored. RELEASE MODULE generates the same error 1001.
