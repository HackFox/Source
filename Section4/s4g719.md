## ContinuousScroll

This form property determines whether the form is updated as you move the scrollbar's thumb.

### Usage

```foxpro
lRefreshWhileScrolling = frmForm.ContinuousScroll
frmForm.ContinuousScroll = lRefreshWhileScrolling
```

You know that little box on a scrollbar that shows you about where you are in the document, the one that you can grab and move to quickly scroll? It's called the "thumb." (Rumor has it that it got that name because it's modeled after a thumbwheel, literally a wheel moved by the thumb, on a bombsight.)

ContinuousScroll determines how a form behaves when you move the thumb of one of its scrollbars. When it's .T., the form is updated as the thumb moves. This is the way MODIFY COMMAND windows behave. When ContinuousScroll is .F., the form doesn't get refreshed until you stop dragging and release the mouse button. This is how Browses act. 

On the whole, we're inclined to leave this one .T. and change it only if the form has so much complex stuff on it that refreshing continuously overtaxes the system. Since this one can be changed at runtime, you could let the user be in charge.

Like the xScrollSmallChange properties, we're not sure why grids and edit boxes don't have this property, too.

### Example

```foxpro
* Turn it off
ThisForm.ContinuousScroll = .F.
```
