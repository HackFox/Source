## APrinters()

This function asks Windows about installed printers and stores the results in an array.

### Usage

```foxpro
nPrinterCount = APrinters( ArrayName )
```
<table border cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=100%>
<tr>
  <td width=32% valign=top>
  <p><b>Parameter</b></p>
  </td>
  <td width=23% valign=top>
  <p><b>Value</b></p>
  </td>
  <td width=45% valign=top>
  <p><b>Meaning</b></p>
  </td>
 </tr>
<tr>
  <td width=32% valign=top>
  <p>ArrayName</p>
  </td>
  <td width=23% valign=top>
  <p>Name</p>
  </td>
  <td width=45% valign=top>
  <p>Array in which to place printer information.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
<tr>
  <td width=32% rowspan=2 valign=top>
  <p>nPrinterCount</p>
  </td>
  <td width=23% valign=top>
  <p>Positive Number</p>
  </td>
  <td width=45% valign=top>
  <p>The number of rows in the array, which equals the number of installed printers.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
<tr>
  <td width=33% valign=top>
  <p>0</p>
  </td>
  <td width=67% valign=top>
  <p>No printers are installed.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

The array that is created has two columns. The first column contains the name of the printer (as shown in the Printers applet in the Control Panel) while the second contains the name of the port for which the printer is installed. Both columns are character. 

Using APRINTERS() doesn't guarantee that a printer is actually connected and available, only that it was once installed in Windows. You still have to cope with broken, missing, or off-line printers.

### Example

```foxpro
? APrinters(aPrinterList)
```
