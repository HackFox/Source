## Close All

CLOSE ALL is a kitchen sink command. It closes databases, tables and their indexes, and any files opened via the low-level file functions. It also closes certain system windows, but not user-defined windows. It closes alternate files, format files, procedure files and class libraries. Basically, it does everything the individual CLOSE commands do, plus a little more.

### Usage

```foxpro

```
### Example
