## Deleted

This event fires when you click in the delete mark column in a grid.

### Usage

```foxpro
PROCEDURE grdGrid.Deleted
LPARAMETERS nRecNo
```

The name Deleted is a little misleading, because the event fires whenever you click in the delete mark column, whether you're deleting or recalling the record. The record number of the affected record is passed to nRecNo.

<table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=100%>
<tr>
  <td width=17% valign=top>
<img width=95 height=78 src="fixbug1.gif"></p>
  </td>
  <td width=83%>
  <p>In VFP 6 and earlier, Help says Deleted fires when the DELETE command is used to delete a record, too. It's wrong. None of Xbase DELETE, DELETE-SQL or RECALL fire Deleted. Only clicks in the delete mark column do it. The Help bug is fixed in VFP 7, though the new text is a little ambiguous.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

Use NODEFAULT in the method to prevent the deletion or recall. Better yet, set DeleteMark to .F. and the user can't delete records in the grid at all.

### Example

```foxpro
PROCEDURE Deleted
* Confirm the deletion.
LPARAMETERS nRecNo

LOCAL nResult
* In this example, the message uses the record number.
* In an application, you'd use data from the record.
nResult = MESSAGEBOX("Do you really want to delete record?" ;
          + LTRIM(STR(nRecNo)), MB_YESNO + MB_ICONQUESTION)
IF nResult = IDNO
   NODEFAULT
ENDIF

ENDPROC
```
