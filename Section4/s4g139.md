## Set Notify, Set("Notify")

This command determines whether an assortment of system messages are displayed. In Visual FoxPro, it seems as though there's no rhyme nor reason as to which messages are covered by NOTIFY, but the secret is that, back in FoxPro/DOS days, all of these appeared in a WAIT WINDOW. Some of these messages have moved to the status bar (when it's available), but they're still affected by this setting.

### Usage

```foxpro
SET NOTIFY ON | OFF
cNotifySetting = SET( "NOTIFY" )
```

Among the messages controlled by SET NOTIFY are the automatic messages associated with input, such as the "Range" message for spinners (or text boxes with Range events) and the "Invalid Input", "Invalid Date" and "Invalid Date/Time" messages. Because of this, you'll usually want to SET NOTIFY OFF in your applications.

### Example

```foxpro
SET NOTIFY OFF
```
