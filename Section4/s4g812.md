## Set BrowseIME, Set("BrowseIME")

This setting and its accompanying function are for those working with double-byte character sets. They determine and indicate, respectively, whether an Input Method Editor (IME) opens automatically when you land in a text box in a Browse. 

### Usage

```foxpro
SET BROWSEIME ON | OFF
cOnOrOff = SET( "BROWSEIME" )
```

An IME is used for entering characters in Eastern languages like Chinese and Korean. For a full explanation of IME's (well, as full as we can give from our Western perspective), see IMEStatus().

With single-byte character sets, this setting is ignored. 

Though listed in the documentation and IntelliSense as BrowseIME, both the SET command and function also work using the full name of BrowseIMEControl. This corresponds to the check box on the General tab of the Tools | Options dialog.
