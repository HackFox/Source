## CodePage

This property contains the codepage assigned to a file.

### Usage

```foxpro
nCodePage = filFile.CodePage
```

The codepage associated with a file indicates its underlying character set. This property lets you find out which one it is. 

You can't set a file's codepage by changing this property, which sort of makes sense to us, because the project doesn't own the file. The same file might be part of dozens of projects and must have the same codepage regardless of project. If you want to set a file's codepage, check out COPY TO. On the other hand, you can change the codepage of files other than DBFs through the Project Manager interface, and the same arguments apply there. So we're confused about the disparity.

### Example

```foxpro
? oProj.Files[3].CodePage
```
