## _PSpacing

This system variable determines the line spacing for output generated with ? and ??. 

### Usage

```foxpro
_PSPACING = nLineSpacing
```

You can set _PSpacing to anything you want, as long as it's between 1 and 3. Only the integer part of the value is significant&mdash;no line-and-a-half spacing allowed.

### Example

```foxpro
SET PRINT TO test.txt
SET PRINT ON

_PSPACING = 2
FOR ncnt = 1 TO 20
   _PCOLNO = 2*ncnt
   ?? "Line "+PADL(ncnt,2)
   ?
ENDFOR

SET PRINT OFF
SET PRINT TO
* Note that the line spacing is doubled
```
