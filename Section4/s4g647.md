## Sys(3053)

This one is only for those brave souls who've mastered the mysteries of ODBC (Open DataBase Connectivity, Microsoft's contribution to the client-server world). It opens a connection to ODBC and returns the handle to that connection. The handle can then be used in calls to the ODBC API (Application Programming Interface).

### Usage

```foxpro
nODBCHandle = SYS(3053)
```

We don't know too many people who make direct calls to ODBC. Unless you've paid your dues with the ODBC SDK (boy, Microsoft really is into three- and four-letter acronyms, isn't it?), we suggest you don't do this.

### Example

```foxpro
nHandle = SYS(3053)
```
