## LastModified

This property belongs to files in a project and indicates when the file was last changed. Not surprisingly, it's read-only.

### Usage

```foxpro
tLastChanged = filFile.LastModified
```

To get to this information through the interface, you have to go to the Files page of the Project Info dialog. On the whole, we think accessing this property may be easier.

### Example

```foxpro
* See whether file is recent
IF oFile.LastModified < DATE()-30
  WAIT WINDOW "You should check for an updated version of " + ;
              oFile.Name
ENDIF
```
