## _PLength, _PLineNo

These variables are part of the printer control system for streamed output produced with ? and ??. _PLENGTH determines the length of a page, and _PLINENO determines the current line number.

None of this has anything to do with reports generated in the Report Designer.

### Usage

```foxpro
_PLENGTH = nPageSizeInLines
nPageSizeInLines = _PLENGTH
_PLINENO = nNextLineToUse
nNextLineToUse = _PLINENO
```

_PLENGTH and _PLINENO interact with the ON PAGE command to determine when that command's event fires. 

Setting _PLINENO doesn't change where the next line appears. It simply changes where the streaming output engine thinks it's printing.

### Example

```foxpro
* See ON PAGE
```
