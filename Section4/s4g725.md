## GoBack, GoForward

These commands instruct the current Active Document host to navigate back or forward through its history list.

### Usage

```foxpro
oLink.GoBack()
oLink.GoForward()
```

The Go commands mean nothing when running in a VFP shell, and nothing happens. Only when the hyperlink object is in an ActiveDocument that is itself hosted in a browser supporting history do the GoBack() and GoForward() methods actually navigate the browser to another address. 

### Example

```foxpro
oLink.GoBack()
oLink.GoForward()
```
