## Accept, Input

These are antique, obsolete, dinosaurous ways to get user input. They date back to the very origins of Xbase. Don't use them.

### Usage

```foxpro
ACCEPT [ cPrompt ] TO cVariable
INPUT [ cPrompt ] TO Variable
```

ACCEPT can be used only for character input. INPUT accepts characters, numbers, dates, datetimes, logicals and currency, but characters must be delimited by quotes or square brackets, logicals (and .NULL.) by periods, dates and datetimes by curly brackets, and currency preceded by your currency symbol.

Not only are these commands totally obscure, but the results are likely to be ugly. The prompt is displayed in the font of the window that contains it, while the user's input is always displayed in 9-point FoxFont. That's as good a reason as any to stay away from these commands.

### Example

```foxpro
ACCEPT "Enter a String" TO cStr
INPUT "Enter a Number" TO nNum
```
