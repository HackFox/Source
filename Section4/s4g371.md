## IsExclusive(), IsReadOnly()

These two functions tell you what kind of access you have to a table or database.

### Usage

```foxpro
lExclusive = ISEXCLUSIVE( [ cAlias | nWorkArea | cDatabase
                          [ , nType ] ] )
lReadOnly = ISREADONLY( [ cAlias | nWorkArea | 0 ] )
```

Before Visual FoxPro, you had to mess with SYS(2011) to figure out if a table was open for exclusive access. ISEXCLUSIVE() is much more intuitively named, and since it returns a logical, it's easy to incorporate in code and doesn't depend on the language you're using.

ISREADONLY() indicates whether the specified table or database is read-only because it was opened in read-only mode or is marked as read-only at the operating system level. This function was on many developers' "most wanted" list for a long time. It makes it easier to write black-box routines that might process either tables or cursors. (By default, cursors created by SQL-SELECT are read-only.) Prior to VFP 7, this function only accepted table aliases, not database containers, which was a shame since a DBC can be opened read-only. Fortunately, VFP 7 adds the ability to determine how a DBC was opened.

### Example

```foxpro
SET EXCLUSIVE ON
OPEN DATABASE TasTrade NOUPDATE
USE Customer
? ISEXCLUSIVE()  && Returns .T.
USE Customer SHARED
? ISEXCLUSIVE()  && Returns .F.
SET EXCLUSIVE OFF
USE Customer
? ISEXCLUSIVE()  && Returns .F.
USE Customer EXCLUSIVE
? ISEXCLUSIVE()  && Returns .T.
? ISEXCLUSIVE("TasTrade",2)  && Returns .T.
USE Customer NOUPDATE
? ISREADONLY()            && Returns .T.
USE Customer
? ISREADONLY()            && Returns .F.
SELECT Last_Name,First_Name FROM Employee INTO CURSOR Names
? ISREADONLY()            && Returns .T.
? ISREADONLY("Employee")  && Returns .F.
? ISREADONLY(0)         && Returns .T.
```
