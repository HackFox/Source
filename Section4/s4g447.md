## CurrentX, CurrentY

A number of form methods draw right on the form. These two properties track the position of the drawing pen.

### Usage

```foxpro
frmForm.CurrentX = nXPosition
nXPosition = frmForm.CurrentX
frmForm.CurrentY = nYPosition
nYPosition = frmForm.CurrentY
```

Several of the drawing methods use CurrentX and CurrentY as defaults if you omit position parameters. All the drawing methods change the value of CurrentX and CurrentY. Like all drawing routines, units are expressed based on the current ScaleMode setting.

### Example

```foxpro
? _SCREEN.CurrentX, _SCREEN.CurrentY
_SCREEN.Box(100, 100, 200, 250)
? _SCREEN.CurrentX, _SCREEN.CurrentY
_SCREEN.CLS
? _SCREEN.CurrentX, _SCREEN.CurrentY
_SCREEN.DrawWidth = 10
_SCREEN.PSet()
? _SCREEN.CurrentX, _SCREEN.CurrentY
```
