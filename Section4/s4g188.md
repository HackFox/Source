## Show Get, Show Object

These two commands were essential in the READ-oriented world of 2.x. They refresh the display of individual controls. SHOW GET references the control by the name of the underlying variable, while SHOW OBJECT refers to it by its unique object number. 

SHOW GET and SHOW OBJECT also let you change the caption of a button or check box, enable or disable a control, and change a control's colors.

In Visual FoxPro, these commands are only relevant for old code. In new code, use Visual FoxPro's controls and manipulate their properties directly. To update the display of a control, use its Refresh method.
