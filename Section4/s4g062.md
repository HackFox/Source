## Browse, Change, Edit, Set BrStatus

What can we say about BROWSE? It's a contender for the most complex and powerful command in the language. It's also a contender for the most dangerous&mdash;handing an unknowing user a BROWSE without appropriate safeguards is like giving a toddler a magnet and your backup tapes.

CHANGE and EDIT are just other names for BROWSE. They present the same data in a different format. SET BRSTATUS determines whether you get a status bar when you're in a BROWSE, even if you've turned the status bar off.

### Usage

BROWSE has no place in applications. In FoxPro 2.x, you could make some argument for it because there were no good alternatives. You either used BROWSE or lived without its row-at-a-time view of data. In Visual FoxPro, you can use a grid for that view and ignore BROWSE except as a powerful, interactive tool for you, the developer. As for CHANGE/EDIT, it's been obsolete for a long time.

BROWSE does have one clause in Visual FoxPro worth learning. A BROWSE is really just a grid, although you can't find a BROWSE's Parent. The NAME clause lets you manipulate the grid with its PEMs, instead of relying on the same old confusing, complex clauses. The table below maps BROWSE's clauses to the grid and column properties, events and methods that give you the same (or often better) functionality.

While not every clause has a corresponding property or event, enough of them do to reduce what you have to do with BROWSE itself to pretty minimal&mdash;a good thing.

One item here is worth noting. Despite the fact that it's not even documented for VFP 6 and later, the IN MACDESKTOP clause creates a free-floating browse window with its own entry on the taskbar.

### Example

```foxpro
* BROWSE is great when you're working interactively.
USE Customer
BROWSE FIELDS Company_Name,Contact_Name,Phone
```
### Usage

```foxpro
SET BRSTATUS ON | OFF
cBrStatus = SET("BRSTATUS")
```

This one's an antique dating back before Windows and its status bar. It determines what happens when you open a BROWSE and there's no visible status bar. If BRSTATUS is ON, the Xbase-style status bar appears.
