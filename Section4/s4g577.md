## Sys(1271)

This function, also a late addition to VFP 3, tells you the name of the form in which an instantiated object is stored.

### Usage

```foxpro
uFileName = SYS( 1271, oObject )
```
<table border cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=100%>
<tr>
  <td width=25% valign=top>
  <p><b>Property</b></p>
  </td>
  <td width=14% valign=top>
  <p><b>Value</b></p>
  </td>
  <td width=61% valign=top>
  <p><b>Purpose</b></p>
  </td>
 </tr>
<tr>
  <td width=25% valign=top>
  <p>oObject</p>
  </td>
  <td width=14% valign=top>
  <p>Object</p>
  </td>
  <td width=61% valign=top>
  <p>The object for which you want to know the file name.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
<tr>
  <td width=25% rowspan=2 valign=top>
  <p>uFileName</p>
  </td>
  <td width=14% valign=top>
  <p>Character</p>
  </td>
  <td width=61% valign=top>
  <p>The complete path and file name for the form containing oObject.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
<tr>
  <td width=19% valign=top>
  <p>.F.</p>
  </td>
  <td width=81% valign=top>
  <p>oObject doesn't come from a form stored in an SCX file.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

We can't quite see why they added this function to the language. If you could hand it any object and find out where it comes from, it would be useful, but it only handles forms created as SCX files and the objects those forms contain. On the other hand, we can't see any other way of getting to this information, so maybe there are some cases where it's useful. For example, Doug uses it when working with multiple instances of the same form. His code renames each instance to have a unique Name, so SYS(1271) lets him figure out that they're all the same form.

Like SYS(1270), this one returns values of two different types for no reason we can see.

### Example

```foxpro
DO FORM Test
? SYS(1271, _SCREEN.ActiveForm)
```
