## TerminateRead

This is another property included only for conversion of FoxPro 2.x screen sets. It corresponds to the Terminate Read option offered by several 2.x controls. When this property is .T. for a control, using that control shuts down the formset.

### Usage

```foxpro
oObject.TerminateRead = lEndItAll
lEndItAll = oObject.TerminateRead
```

This property is relevant only for formsets running in one of the READ compatibility modes (with WindowType = 2 or 3). It's ignored otherwise.
