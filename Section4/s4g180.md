## Activate Screen

By default, output from many commands goes to the active window. ACTIVATE SCREEN lets you direct it to the main Visual FoxPro window instead.

### Usage

```foxpro
ACTIVATE SCREEN
```

When a user-defined window (including one containing a form) is active, issuing a command like DISPLAY MEMORY or ? sends the output to the window. That's not usually what you want. It sure isn't when we do it. Issue ACTIVATE SCREEN before the DISPLAY whatever or ?, and the output goes to the main window instead.

### Example

```foxpro
DEFINE WINDOW Test AT 0,0 SIZE 10,100
ACTIVATE WINDOW Test
* Now all output goes to window Test - prove it
DISPLAY MEMORY
* That's no good - try again
ACTIVATE SCREEN
DISPLAY MEMORY      && much better
RELEASE WINDOW Test && clean up
```
