## CommandButton, CommandGroup

Command buttons are generally use to make something happen. Perhaps the most common command buttons are the ones labeled "OK" and "Cancel" that appear in dozens of dialogs throughout Windows.

In Visual FoxPro, command buttons can be used both singly and in groups. CommandGroups have a Value property that indicates which button in the group was last chosen. The Value can be either character or numeric. When character, it contains the Caption of the button last chosen. When numeric, it's the position of that button in the group. 

Command buttons can contain text or a bitmap or both. In addition, command buttons can be invisible. Of course, in that case, the bitmap and the caption don't do you much good. Invisible buttons are one way to put a "hot spot" on a form. A command group can contain any combination of textual, graphical and invisible buttons.

The relationship between a command group and the buttons in it is different than most of the container/contained object relationships in FoxPro. Normally, if an object doesn't have code in a particular event anywhere in its class hierarchy, no code runs when that event fires. For command buttons in a command group (and option buttons in an option group), 'tain't so. If a button has no Click code, for example, the group's Click code executes. If the button doesn't have anything in MouseDown, the group's MouseDown fires. Pretty cool. In fact, this is what control arrays were supposed to be all about. 

However, for properties, the behavior propagates downward, but not the property values. That is, setting Enabled to .F. for a control group disables all the buttons in the group, but they're not dimmed and their individual Enabled properties remain .T. We've got mixed feelings on this one. We can see why it's nice to maintain the individual values&mdash;when you re-enable the group, it's good that buttons that were disabled before are still disabled. But the lack of a visual cue means we can't take advantage of this behavior. (In VFP 6 and later, you can use an Assign method for the group's Enabled to change the Enabled property of the individual buttons in the group. This does raise the issue of remembering what was enabled before the change to the group.)

Since command buttons have a separate existence, there's no problem subclassing them visually. However, there's no way visually to tell a subclass of CommandGroup to use your CommandButton subclass. For this reason among others, we rarely use CommandGroups, sticking to individual buttons instead.

Like OptionButtons and OptionGroups, the interaction between the AutoSize properties of CommandButtons and CommandGroups is strange. You can have autosized buttons inside a non-autosized group with the result that the group's border clips the button itself.

### Example

```foxpro
* Perhaps the most common button of all.
* Of course, we'd do this in the Class Designer.
DEFINE CLASS CloseButton AS CommandButton

   Caption = "\<Close"
   ToolTipText = "Close this form"

   PROCEDURE Click
      IF EMPTY(ThisForm.PARENT)  && A stand-alone form
         ThisForm.Release()
      ELSE
         ThisFormSet.Release() && A formset
      ENDIF
   ENDPROC
ENDDEFINE
```
