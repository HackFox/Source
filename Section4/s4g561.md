## Resizable

This property determines whether a column's width can be changed interactively.

### Usage

```foxpro
grcColumn.Resizable = lResizable
lResizable = grcColumn.Resizable
```

It is possible that you will want to keep certain columns of a grid at a fixed width, in order to prevent data from being either hidden or exposed. This is the property to set to do that. However, keep in mind that if any columns have the Movable property set, it might be possible to move the column off the viewable area.

### Example

```foxpro
ThisForm.Grid1.Column1.Resizable = .T.
```
