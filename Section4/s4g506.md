## HideSelection

This property determines whether selected text remains highlighted when focus moves to another control. The default is for the highlight to disappear when focus changes.

### Usage

```foxpro
oObject.HideSelection = lHideIt
lHideIt = oObject.HideSelection
```

The controls that support selection of text are text boxes, edit boxes, spinners and combo boxes (only in combo mode&mdash;not as drop-downs). For some reason, combo boxes didn't have a HideSelection property in VFP 3, but that was remedied in VFP 5.

<table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=100%>
<tr>
  <td width=17% valign=top>
<img width=95 height=78 src="bug.gif"></p>
  </td>
  <td width=83%>
  <p>HideSelection doesn't affect spinners at all. That's because spinners don't remember their selection properly as soon as they lose focus. See SelLength for the details on this bug.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

You'll usually want to leave HideSelection set to .T. Things get confusing when too many highlights appear. Setting HideSelection to .F. (that is, letting all the highlights show) seems most useful when you want to perform some operation on the selected text.

### Example

```foxpro
ThisForm.Edit1.HideSelection = .F.
```
