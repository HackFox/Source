## BeforeDropView, AfterDropView

These database events fire when a view is removed from a database, whether programmatically using the DELETE VIEW or DROP VIEW commands, or visually using the Database Designer.

### Usage

```foxpro
PROCEDURE DBC_BeforeDropView( cViewName )

PROCEDURE DBC_AfterDropView( cViewName )
```
<table border cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=100%>
<tr>
  <td width=32% valign=top>
  <p><b>Parameter</b></p>
  </td>
  <td width=23% valign=top>
  <p><b>Value</b></p>
  </td>
  <td width=45% valign=top>
  <p><b>Meaning</b></p>
  </td>
 </tr>
<tr>
  <td width=32% valign=top>
  <p>cViewName</p>
  </td>
  <td width=23% valign=top>
  <p>Character</p>
  </td>
  <td width=45% valign=top>
  <p>The name of the view.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

As with other before-and-after pairs of events, you can prevent a view from being removed by returning .F. in the BeforeDropView event, while the AfterDropView event is simply notified that a view was removed.

### Example

```foxpro
* This goes in the stored procedures for a database.

PROCEDURE DBC_BeforeDropView(cViewName)
WAIT WINDOW PROGRAM() + CHR(13) + ;
    'cViewName: ' + cViewName

PROCEDURE DBC_AfterDropView(cViewName)
WAIT WINDOW PROGRAM() + CHR(13) + ;
    'cViewName: ' + cViewName

* End of stored procedures.
* Create a view, and then remove it.

CREATE SQL VIEW TestView AS SELECT * FROM CUSTOMER
DROP VIEW TestView
```
