## Clear Windows

The last in the long list of Clear commands releases all user-defined windows from memory. It takes form windows as well as those defined with DEFINE WINDOW.

### Usage

```foxpro
CLEAR WINDOWS
```

When form windows are released with CLEAR WINDOWS, the variables that reference them are not released&mdash;instead, they become .NULL.
