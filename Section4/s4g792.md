## Close Indexes

They ought to call this one "Close Most Indexes." It closes stand-alone and non-structural compound indexes for the table in the current work area, but fortunately has no effect on the structural index file.

### Usage

```foxpro
CLOSE INDEXES
```

This command is pretty much obsolete since you should rarely, if ever, use any index files other than the structural index file.
