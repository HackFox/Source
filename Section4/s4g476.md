## AllowTabs

This property determines how Tabs behave in an edit box. 

### Usage

```foxpro
edtEditBox.AllowTabs = lAllowTabs
lAllowTabs = edtEditBox.AllowTabs
```

If AllowTabs is .F., which is the default, pressing Tab moves to the next control. If it's .T., the tab is added to the text; in this case, of course, Tab doesn't move you to the next control. But, in either case, you can use Ctrl+Tab to move forward and Ctrl+Shift+Tab to move backward. Our cut on this: Unless you design your user interface so that tabs are not needed anywhere else in the system, don't expect your users to remember when they can Tab and when they can't. Leave this one alone. If you really need Tabs in an edit box, include a note on the form telling the user how to move out of the box. If you need to allow input of formatted text, consider using the RichText control.

### Example

```foxpro
* You might want to tell the user about CTRL+TAB
* to move on. You could set a label's caption:
ThisForm.lblCtrlTab.Caption = ;
    IIF(ThisForm.edtEditBox.AllowTabs, ;
        "CTRL+TAB when done ", "")
```
