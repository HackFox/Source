## Define Box, _Box

DEFINE BOX is one of those commands you should forget you ever noticed. What it's supposed to do is draw a box around output data. In FoxPro/DOS, this command worked more or less as intended. 

<table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=100%>
<tr>
  <td width=17% valign=top>
<img width=95 height=77 src="bug.gif"></p>
  </td>
  <td width=83%>
  <p>As far as we can tell, it doesn't work at all for printed output in Visual FoxPro (nor did it work in FoxPro/Windows); and it works badly when you SET PRINT TO a file.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

_BOX determines whether DEFINE BOX actually draws a box or not. For output to file, it appears to work as advertised.

Don't use DEFINE BOX! Use the Report Designer to create output and take advantage of its box-drawing tool. Use the form's built-in Box() method to draw simple boxes on forms, or the new Shape control if finer control is needed, but avoid this mess at all costs!
