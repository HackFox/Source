## Exit

This command works only within a loop. It immediately exits the loop and continues the program with the statement following the loop-closing command (ENDDO, ENDFOR/NEXT, or ENDSCAN).

We don't use EXIT except in a few closely controlled circumstances because it makes code too hard to maintain. This is a "Beam me up, Scotty" command which can lead to spaghetti code.
