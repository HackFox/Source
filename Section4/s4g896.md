## Display Users, List Users, Fixed(), Float(), Logout, Rollback(), Set Attributes, Set Encryption, Set History, Set Menu, Set Pause, Set Title

The commands in this group have two things in common: They aren't documented and they don't do anything. So, why are we even mentioning them? Because they appear in the VFP executable, and we suppose it's conceivable that somewhere out there is some code that uses them. A few of them turn up in the lists produced by ALanguage(), as well. There's also the possibility that you'll write a routine with one of these names (well, the one-word names, anyway) and it won't behave as you'd expect. So, knowing that these are reserved words could save you a lot of hair-pulling.

We suspect that most of these made their way into the language for compatibility with some other Xbase variant. One of them, SET HISTORY, does appear in our FoxBase+ 2 manuals, and we sort of remember it doing something useful there.

As for the others, they won't do any damage, and the only one that causes an error is ROLLBACK(). All of the SET commands here do have corresponding SET() functions to provide their current values, for what those are worth.
