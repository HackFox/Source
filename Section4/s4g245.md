## _PAdvance

This used to be one of the most useful of the printer variables. It let you determine whether page breaks were made up of a single form-feed character (Ctrl+L or CHR(12)) or as many linefeeds (CHR(10)) as needed to get to the top of the next page. This one saved an awful lot of people with odd-sized paper.

But, as far as we can tell, it doesn't work with the Report Designer (though we're pretty sure it did in FoxPro 2.x). Since that's the way to go for reporting, _PADVANCE has become obsolete. (It does actually work with @SAY reports, but who wants to write those?)

### Usage

```foxpro
_PADVANCE = "FORMFEED" | "LINEFEEDS"
```
### Example

```foxpro
_PADVANCE = "FORMFEED"
SET DEVICE TO PRINT
SET PRINT TO TEST.TXT
FOR nBatch = 1 TO 20
   FOR nRow = 1 TO 10
      @nRow,1 SAY "Line "+PADL(nRow,2)
   ENDFOR
ENDFOR
SET PRINT TO
SET DEVICE TO SCREEN
* Check Test.Txt and you'll see the CHR(12)'s after each batch
```
