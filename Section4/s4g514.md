## ListCount

This property tells you how many items are in a list or combo box. To our pleasant surprise, it works regardless of the method used for filling the list or combo.

### Usage

```foxpro
nItems = oObject.ListCount
```

As the Help says, ListCount is a read-only property. You can look, but you can't touch. It's most useful for traversing the List or ListItem collection (or any of the collections associated with lists and combos, actually). Of course, in VFP 5 and later versions, you can use FOR EACH to do that, so you don't have to know how many items there are.

### Example

```foxpro
* Tell the user how many choices there are
WAIT WINDOW "You have " + ;
            LTRIM(STR(ThisForm.lstMyList.ListCount)) + ;
            "choices." NOWAIT
```
