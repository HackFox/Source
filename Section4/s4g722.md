## Run

This ambiguously named event is the main program for active documents.

### Usage

```foxpro
PROCEDURE acdActiveDoc.Run
LPARAMETERS cHyperLinkTarget
```
<table border cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=100%>
<tr>
  <td width=32% valign=top>
  <p><b>Parameter</b></p>
  </td>
  <td width=23% valign=top>
  <p><b>Value</b></p>
  </td>
  <td width=45% valign=top>
  <p><b>Meaning</b></p>
  </td>
 </tr>
<tr>
  <td width=32% valign=top>
  <p>cHyperLinkTarget</p>
  </td>
  <td width=23% valign=top>
  <p>Character</p>
  </td>
  <td width=45% valign=top>
  <p>Additional information that can be appended to the address of your ActiveDoc and passed as a parameter. See the example below. Requires that the ActiveDoc be on a Web site and navigated to via HTTP.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

When you run an ActiveDoc application, a bunch of things happen on the way in (like the Browser starting up, if it's appropriate). Once all that's done and the ActiveDoc object has been created and situated, this event fires. This is the place to do all those things that normally live in the main program of your application, or, if you prefer, just call the main program of your application. Normally, this method either contains READ EVENTS or calls a routine that does.

### Example

```foxpro
* Here's a simple Run method that puts up one form
* and issues a READ EVENTS
DO FORM MyMainForm
READ EVENTS

* Three different sites might link to your ActiveDoc, and want
* to pass to the Run parameter their settings. Site 1 would have
* a link of :
http://www.yoursite.com/yourdoc.app#Site1Parameters
* site 2 might be
http://www.yoursite.com/yourdoc.app#Site2Parameters
```
