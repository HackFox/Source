## Sys(2029)

This function returns the type and some clues to the origin of a DBF table.

### Usage

```foxpro
cTableType = SYS( 2029 [, nWorkArea | cAlias ] )
```

You can see the return values in the FoxPro help file and documentation: "0," "48," and "245" for "No table open," "FoxPro 3.0 table," and "FoxPro 2.x with memo field," respectively. Why these bizarre values? The secret to these weird values is that the values are the decimal equivalent of the very first byte of the file, established by Ashton-Tate and Fox Software over the years as the flag that these files contain their proprietary structures.

### Example

```foxpro
? SYS(2029)
```
