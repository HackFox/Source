## ColumnLines

At last! Simple vertical lines between columns in a ListBox or ComboBox!

### Usage

```foxpro
oObject.ColumnLines = lShowLines
lShowLines = oObject.ColumnLines
```

Years ago, we spent quite a bit of time, as did nearly everyone else, trying to find ways to simulate multiple columns in list boxes. Visual FoxPro makes it easy! ColumnLines allows us to determine whether or not vertical lines appear between the columns. By default it is set .T. to show lines. In order to have your lines appear as single solid lines running down the list or combo, you'll need to change the control's font to a fixed-width font (bleh!&mdash;lousy idea, and leads to a nonstandard, awkward interface) or diddle with the ColumnWidths property.

Column lines are an all-or-nothing deal. You have them either between every column or no columns. You can't specify which ones you want.

### Example

```foxpro
lboListBox.ColumnLines = .T.
```
