## Timer Event

The Timer event fires each time a Timer has counted down the specified Interval of time.

### Usage

```foxpro
Procedure tmrTimer.Timer
```

The Timer procedure is the place you put the code you want to run after each Timer event has been reached. The Timer's interval is specified (in milliseconds) with the Timer's Interval property; a Timer is enabled if its Enabled property is .T. and the Interval is greater than 0.

### Example

```foxpro
PROCEDURE Timer1.Timer
  WAIT WINDOW NOWAIT "Time's Up!"
ENDPROC
```
