## Filer

Alas, poor Filer, we knew it well. Issuing this command in VFP 5 or later results in "Unrecognized command verb." Not so much as a decent sendoff.

The good news, even though the command itself has been removed from the language, is that the Filer utility lives on. In the Tools/Filer subdirectory of your main VFP directory is a Filer form. It uses a Filer.DLL to do the heavy lifting of searching through the directory structures. The DLL is a COM object available to any COM hosting tool, like VFP. 

The form supplied is just a sample of what can be done. The tool itself is a weak imitation of the power we used to have in Filer itself, but the code is clear and there are at least a few comments. Consider modifying and enhancing the sample form, or perhaps even using the DLL within your own forms for browsing and manipulating files.

### Example

```foxpro
DO FORM LOCFILE(HOME()+"\tools\filer\filer.scx")
```
