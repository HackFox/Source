## ReadCycle, ReadLock, ReadMouse, ReadObject, ReadSave, ReadTimeOut

These formset properties map directly to clauses of the now-obsolete READ. They're used when the Visual FoxPro Converter translates 2.x screen sets into Visual FoxPro.

Except in formsets created by Functional Conversion, you don't even have access to these properties. Well, actually, you have access to them, but it doesn't matter what value you assign&mdash;they're ignored unless WindowType is 2 or 3. And you can't create formsets with WindowType set to 2 or 3, except in code. More importantly, you have no reason to create formsets with WindowType set to 2 or 3.

If you must use functional conversion, let the Converter set these properties to match your 2.x screens. Better yet, stay away from functional conversion and the half-breed forms it creates.

ReadTimeOut is documented as holding seconds (at least in VFP 3&mdash;in later versions, it's just barely documented at all). In fact, it's measured in milliseconds. The Converter does properly detect a #READCLAUSES TimeOut and converts the number it finds to milliseconds.
