## Read Events, Clear Events

These are the commands that hook your forms into the native event loop of Visual FoxPro, as we describe in "A Gala Event." Despite their inclusion in the READ and CLEAR help topics, these commands are best left by themselves, without the extra paraphernalia of the older READ model. READ EVENTS MODAL TIMEOUT 15, for example, while accepted by FoxPro as a valid command, does not time out and does not act modally.

The right way to use READ EVENTS is to issue the command after your application has started up and established its environment, custom menu and global settings. When your application is done, issue CLEAR EVENTS to release your code from the suspended animation of the READ EVENTS event loop, and then your code can proceed to close out all open forms, and close out your application.

### Example

```foxpro
READ EVENTS && start event loop processing
CLEAR EVENTS && end event loop processing
```
