## SCCProvider

This property of the Project object tells you whether the project is under source code control, and if so, who the provider is.

### Usage

```foxpro
cProvider = prjProject.SCCProvider
```

The SCCProvider property returns, as a string, the Registry key under HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE that contains information about the source code control provider for this project. You can use this information to plunge into the Registry and get the settings for this particular provider. As we haven't played with anything other than Visual SourceSafe, we can't tell you much about what you can find there, but you'll probably want to fire up a good Registry editor and see what you can find.

### Example

```foxpro
#DEFINE HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE   0x80000002
lcProvider = oProject.SCCProvider
IF NOT EMPTY(lcProvider)
   oRegistry = NewObject("Registry", ;
                          HOME() + "FFC\Registry.vcx")
   cValue = space(255)
   oRegistry.GetRegKey("SCCServerName ", @cValue, ;
                    lcProvider, HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE)
   ? "The project's database is controlled by " + cValue
ENDIF
```
