## _Beautify, _Browser, _Builder, _Converter, _FoxDoc, _FoxGraph, _Gallery, _GenGraph, _GenHTML, _GenMenu, _GenScrn, _GenXTab, _GetExpr, _ObjectBrowser, _SCCText, _SpellChk, _Transport, _Wizard

These system variables are all hooks. They let you specify a program or application that should run under specific circumstances. A number of them are unused in Visual FoxPro. 

The table below shows the purpose of each hook and its default value. You can change the value of any of these in several ways: Assign it a new value in a program or the Command Window, assign it a value in your Config.FPW file, or, for several of them, set it in the Tools | Options dialog.

Note that some of these variables (like _BEAUTIFY) just give you a reference to the program in use&mdash;changing these variables doesn't affect what happens when you call the appropriate tool from the menu. (There's one exception here. If you set _BEAUTIFY to the empty string, the menu option is disabled.) Others specify the program that's actually called&mdash;changing one of these means that, when you call that tool from the menu, the newly specified program is executed, not the default. In the table, the ones that simply provide a reference use the term "points to," while the others say "called." 

In addition to the automatic ways in which the hooked programs are called, you can run them yourself using DO (_variable). In many cases, you'll need to pass appropriate parameters. See "Builders and Wizards (and Bears, Oh My!)" in Section 5 for the necessary parameters in those cases. Read the source code for VFPXTab and SCCTEXT, and the help file for BROWSER.APP.

You may also want to consider overriding the default setting of these variables with your own, improved code.

The unused variables provide a place to store permanent information. Unlike variables you create, nothing you can do releases these variables. They're as persistent as they come. You might use them to store vital information. (If you take this approach in an application, be sure to document it really well. We use these variables primarily to enhance our development environments.) You might also use them as hooks into things you're interested in. See _ASSIST for an example.

### Example

```foxpro
* Run a crosstab
DO (_GENXTAB) WITH "Result"
