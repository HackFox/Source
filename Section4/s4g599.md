## HalfHeightCaption

This property lets you give a form a title bar that's a little different than the regular one. 

### Usage

```foxpro
frmForm.HalfHeightCaption = lHasHalfHeight
lHasHalfHeight = frmForm.HalfHeightCaption
```

In VFP 3 under Win 3.x, the title bar created by this option really was half-height. We think it was for backward compatibility and conversion of FoxPro/DOS screens, because we couldn't see any reason why you'd want a half-height title bar. They're mucho ugly.

Under the modern versions of Windows, the size of the caption bar changes only very slightly. However, the size of the icon in the upper-left corner changes noticeably. It's a little bigger with HalfHeightCaption set to .T.&mdash;as a side effect of that, the buttons on the right-hand side of the title bar are a little closer together. In addition, the title bar uses a solid color, even if Windows is set for a two-color gradient.

We can't think of any reason at all to touch this property.

### Example

```foxpro
ThisForm.HalfHeightCaption = .T.
```
