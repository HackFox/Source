## LeftC(), RightC(), SubStrC()

These are the double-byte (and mixed) versions of LEFT(), RIGHT() and SUBSTR(), respectively, added in version 3.0b. As with the other double-byte functions, we can't test these thoroughly since we're not running in a double-byte environment. However, they do work properly with single-byte data.

### Usage

```foxpro
cReturnValue = LEFTC( cString, nCharacters )
cReturnValue = RIGHTC( cString, nCharacters )
cReturnValue = SUBSTRC( cString, nStart, nLength )
```
