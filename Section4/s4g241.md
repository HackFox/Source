## _PLOffset, Set Margin

This system variable and command do the same thing. They establish a left border for the printable page when using ? and ??. 

### Usage

```foxpro
_PLOFFSET = nLeftBorder
SET MARGIN TO nLeftBorder
nLeftBorder = _PLOFFSET
nLeftBorder = SET( "MARGIN" )
```

_PLOFFSET and SET MARGIN work only in the printed (or redirected to file) output produced. The echo that appears in the active window ignores them. If _LMARGIN is greater than 0, it gets added to nLeftBorder to produce the actual left margin.

### Example

```foxpro
_PLOFFSET = 15
SET PRINT TO Test.Txt
SET PRINT ON
?"This is a text"
SET PRINT OFF
SET PRINT TO
MODI FILE test.txt&& note indentation
```
