## IsLeadByte()

This function (added in version 3.0b) lets you determine whether a string is double-byte or single-byte. It tells you whether the first byte in the string is a "lead byte" (the first half of a double-byte character). We've confirmed that it returns .F. for single-byte characters, but can't test the other case.

### Usage

```foxpro
lDoubleByte = ISLEADBYTE( cString )
```
