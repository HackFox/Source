## RowHeight

Specifies the height, in pixels, of the rows in a grid. All rows have the same height.

### Usage

```foxpro
Grid.RowHeight = nHeight
nHeight = Grid.RowHeight
```

You can use this property to modify the row height of a grid. You might want to do this if you place controls other than text boxes within the grid. RowHeight is automatically changed if the Grid's FontName or FontSize is altered, so you'll want to make global font changes before manipulating the row's height. We generally prefer to set the font characteristics of each separate column (or even each control), rather than making the overall change, if there are any complex controls within the grid. 

Setting RowHeight to -1 causes the grid to automatically resize to the proper height for the Grid's FontSize. This setting ignores any FontSize settings assigned in columns or text objects, so is appropriate only for a text-only grid with a single font style. Using this technique on a grid with carefully sized check boxes and spinners squashes everything.

### Example

```foxpro
grdGrid1.RowHeight = 23
```
