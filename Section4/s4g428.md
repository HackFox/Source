## Display Connections, List Connections

These commands provide a list of named connections in a database. The name of the connection and the data source or connection string is listed.

### Usage

```foxpro
DISPLAY | LIST CONNECTIONS
        [ TO PRINTER [ PROMPT ] |
          TO [ FILE ] cFileName [ ADDITIVE ] ]
        [ NOCONSOLE ]
```

The same information is available using ADBOBJECTS() and DBGETPROP(). 

A database must be open and current before issuing the command.

### Example

```foxpro
USE MyTestDBC
CREATE CONNECTION TestConnection ;
        DATASOURCE "MS Access 7.0 Databases"
DISPLAY CONNECTIONS
```
