## hWnd

Internally, the Windows operating systems manage all windows objects and many controls (which are really windows internally)  using what are called "handles." A handle is just a numeric reference to a particular window. Certain Windows API functions expect a window handle, or hWnd. Prior to VFP 7, Visual FoxPro internally managed all of the forms and controls in a Visual FoxPro application, and did not bother with the overhead of creating the Windows structures needed to provide a handle.. Now, you simply have to ask a form for its hWnd property.

### Usage

```foxpro
nhWnd = oObject.hWnd()
```

Only four kinds of objects have hWnd properties: forms, toolbars, and the _SCREEN and _VFP objects. hWnd contains a numeric value representing the window handle. This value can be passed to API calls that manipulate windows. 

### Example

```foxpro
* AnimateWindow is an API that applies animation effects when
* Windows are opened or closed.
DECLARE AnimateWindow IN Win32API ;
    LONG Thehwnd, LONG TimeInMilliSeconds, LONG Flags
oForm = CREATEOBJECT("Form")

* When the flag is 1, it "rolls" the form on from left to right.
AnimateWindow(oForm.hWnd, 500, 1)

* Try this with flags of 2, 5 and 16; and vary the number
* of milliseconds for some cool effects.
* A word of caution for this API: This window misbehaves.
* oForm.Hide now claims to be read-only, and oForm.Visible
* accepts values but doesn't change. Test your code using APIs
* <I></i>like these <i>thoroughly</I> before putting it into production.
```
