## Clear Fields

This old command (he played one) combines SET FIELDS TO with SET FIELDS OFF, and applies it to all work areas. It's relevant only if you're using SET FIELDS in the first place.

### Usage

```foxpro
CLEAR FIELDS
```
### Example

```foxpro
USE OneTable
SET FIELDS TO First, Second
SELECT 0
USE Another
SET FIELDS TO Two, Night
CLEAR FIELDS
```
