## Clear All

This one does all kinds of things. It releases variables, menus and their components, and DLL functions, closes and releases windows, closes tables, sweeps the kitchen floor, plows the north 40 and curls your hair overnight.

### Usage

```foxpro
CLEAR ALL
```

Of course, CLEAR ALL doesn't do everything. It doesn't release class libraries, procedure files or external API libraries. It doesn't close system windows or databases. It doesn't clear the system program buffer or the main window.

Nonetheless, we use it all the time. Our minimal "clean up after we've been messing around" sequence is CLOSE ALL, CLEAR ALL.
