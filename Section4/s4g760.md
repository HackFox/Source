## ServerClass, ServerClassLibrary

These properties tell you the lineage of the server you're examining within the Project object.

### Usage

```foxpro
cServerClass = oServer.ServerClass
cSCLibrary = oServer.ServerClassLibrary
```

These two properties of the Server object, which is available through the Project hierarchy, tell you the class definition and the library location of a class defined as OLEPublic. If the class definition is in code, the class name is the name supplied in DEFINE CLASS and the class library is the fully qualified name of the program where the definition resides. In the more common case of a visual class, the ServerClass is the class' Name and the ServerClassLibrary is the fully pathed name of the VCX.

### Example

```foxpro
* Created a test class "fred" in the SYS2335 program
? oProj.servers.item[1].ServerClass         && "fred"
? oProj.servers.item[1].ServerClassLibrary
* Returns "C:\test\sys2335.prg"
```
