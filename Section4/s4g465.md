## Timer

The Timer Control is a cool little device for creating events that fire at predetermined intervals. This is a great replacement for DO...WHILE and INKEY() loops, which chew up a whole bunch of processor time while counting milliseconds. The timer control is flaky and unpredictable in VFP 3.x. The Fox team has done a great job of bringing this one under control in VFP 5 and later versions.

The timer is a control with no visible presence at runtime, but fires its Timer event at a regular, defined Interval. If you messed with this control in VFP 3 and got frustrated, give it another shot. We have to give Microsoft credit where credit is due, and they did a great job with Timer. In the original version of this book, which covered Visual FoxPro 3.0, Timer got credit for a lot of bugs&mdash;even the dreaded double-bug icon&mdash;but in later versions, it appears vastly improved.

Timers fire when the menu is dropped down. They didn't in VFP 3.0. Timers fire in toolbars. Timers fire when a form is being dragged around. Timers fire when another application window is resized, or when Fox's window is resized. Timers fire when your application displays a message box. Awesome!

### Example

```foxpro
* RemindMe.Prg
* This is a pretty trivial example of a program that accepts
* a message and the number of seconds to wait to display that
* message. In the meantime, processing can go on as normal in
* the foreground.
* Pass the message to display, and the
* number of seconds to wait to display it.
LParameters tcMessage, tnTime

_SCREEN.AddProperty("oTimer")
_SCREEN.oTimer = CreateObject("RemindTime", ;
                              tcMessage, ;
                    tnTime * 1000)  && convert to
                                              && milliseconds
RETURN

DEFINE CLASS RemindTime AS Timer
  cMessage = ""
  nTime = 0
  Interval = 5000  && check every 5 seconds
  Procedure Init(tcMessage, tnTime)
    This.cMessage = tcMessage
    This.nTime = tnTime
  EndProc
  Procedure Timer
    This.nTime = This.nTime - This.Interval
    IF This.nTime < 0  && we've exceeded the interval
      MessageBox(This.cMessage)
      This.Enabled = .F.
      RELEASE This
    ENDIF
  EndProc
EndDefine
```
