## Loop

This command ends the current pass in a loop, taking control directly to the loop-ending command (ENDDO, ENDFOR/NEXT, ENDSCAN). Then, the loop condition is evaluated and execution proceeds normally.

Don't use LOOP. It creates spaghetti code and makes maintenance much harder. LOOP can always be replaced by an IF that skips the remaining code in the loop.
