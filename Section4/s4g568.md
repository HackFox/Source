## Puzzle

It's not FreeCell or Myst, but there's a simple little game that was built into FoxPro to help you pass the time waiting for a printout. Regrettably, it was removed in VFP 5.0.

### Usage

```foxpro
ACTIVATE WINDOW PUZZLE
```

Puzzle was introduced with the FoxPro 2.0 interface, as one of the Mac-like Desk Accessories. (In fact, it's a rip-off of the puzzle found on the Mac's apple menu.) It is not available from the menu interface in Visual FoxPro 3.0, but it's still in there. Add the menu bar _MST_PUZZLE to your custom menu, or issue the command above to make it appear. In later versions, the menu errors with "Feature not available," and the command complains, "Window 'PUZZLE' has not been defined."
