## AddToSCC, RemoveFromSCC

These two methods of the File object allow an individual file to come under, or be freed from, source code control.

### Usage

```foxpro
lResult = filFile.AddToSCC()
lResult = filFile.RemoveFromSCC()
```

Use these two methods to add a file to your source code control system or remove it.

<table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=100%>
<tr>
  <td width=17% valign=top>
<img width=94 height=94 src="Design.gif"></p>
  </td>
  <td width=83%>
  <p>Like the other SCC methods, these commands suffer from confirmation dialogs getting in the way of the processing. This means that you can't entirely automate things&mdash;you'll have to manually click in these dialogs. Since they aren't part of Fox's interface, even a risky maneuver like KEYBOARDing values won't work.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

### Example

```foxpro
* Clear all the files in a project out of SCC
oProject = _VFP.ActiveProject
FOR EACH oFile IN oProject.Files
  IF oFile.ReadOnly  && if .T., it is under SCC
    oFile.RemoveFromSCC()
  ENDIF
ENDFOR
```
