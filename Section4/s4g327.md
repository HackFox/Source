## @ ... Scroll

This command would be a cool one if it produced the magic scroll you need to get to the next level in the adventure game, perhaps with some cool window-shade-scrolling effects, but alas, it is another of the legacy commands, left over from a character-based world long, long ago, and best avoided like the plague.

### Usage

```foxpro
@ nRow, nColumn SCROLL
  [ LEFT | RIGHT | UP | DOWN ]
  [ BY nIncrement ]
```

Although some interesting effects can be created with this command, generally we feel it is best left alone. Like the form's direct drawing methods (Box, Circle, Line, etc.), the scrolling that takes place is overwritten when the screen or page is refreshed, as underlying objects which are moved do not have their appropriate properties changed. Use the Top, Left, Height and Width properties of objects to move them around on a form.

### Example

```foxpro
@ 5,5 to 10, 10 SCROLL UP by 2
```
