## _Shell

_SHELL can be used to replace the command window with a different program shell.

### Usage

```foxpro
_SHELL = cCommand
cCommand = _SHELL
```

Some users, we've observed, are just not safe with the interactive development version of Visual FoxPro. (Some of them aren't safe with computers at all, but that's another topic...) To think about one of these folks getting access to the Command Window makes us wonder why we didn't get into some safe profession, like bungee testing. If the user absolutely, positively has to have the development version of Visual FoxPro, you can use the _SHELL variable to always run your program instead of dropping back to the Command Window. You can set this in your configuration file with the equivalent _SHELL command.

Each time _SHELL is invoked, it clears the _SHELL setting, so you'll need to reset it in your application.

If you think your users are absolutely, completely safe with your application while they run the interactive version, think about these three little letters: Z...A...P...

### Example

```foxpro
_SHELL = "DO SAFEMENU.PRG"
```
