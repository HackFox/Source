## ReadKey()

We didn't use this function much in FoxPro 2.x. We don't use it at all in Visual FoxPro. It tells you how the last READ or full-screen editing command was exited.

### Usage

```foxpro
nCode = READKEY( [ nReadOnly ] )
```

The optional parameter tells READKEY() to pay attention only to the last READ and indicate the cause for its death. Otherwise, the function returns information about the last full-screen editing command that ended&mdash;this includes Browse, Append, Read and a few others.

See Help for the list of codes returned if you have to maintain old code that includes this function. Don't write any new code using it.
