## ClipControls

This property controls how Visual FoxPro redraws the form and its contents when controls moving around or appearing and disappearing cause new areas to be exposed, or when Refresh or another event causes Paint to fire&mdash;this could happen by changing the size of a control, moving it, or changing the Z-order to move controls around from front to back.

### Usage

```foxpro
oObject.ClipControls = lSlowerVideo
lSlowerVideo = oObject.ClipControls
```
<table border cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=100%>
<tr>
  <td width=32% valign=top>
  <p><b>Parameter</b></p>
  </td>
  <td width=23% valign=top>
  <p><b>Value</b></p>
  </td>
  <td width=45% valign=top>
  <p><b>Meaning</b></p>
  </td>
 </tr>
<tr>
  <td width=32% rowspan=2 valign=top>
  <p>lSlowerVideo</p>
  </td>
  <td width=23% valign=top>
  <p>.T.</p>
  </td>
  <td width=45% valign=top>
  <p>The form is repainted in a slower, more reliable mode, where all objects are fully repainted. This is the default.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
<tr>
  <td width=33% valign=top>
  <p>.F.</p>
  </td>
  <td width=67% valign=top>
  <p>Screen objects revealed are repainted quickly, redrawing only those portions of the object newly revealed.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

In highly unscientific tests here at Hacker Labs, consuming most of an otherwise perfectly fine summer afternoon, we were not able to see any significant difference in the speed of repainting text-based controls, graphics drawn with the graphics methods, graphic controls, or just about anything else we could throw on a form. We suspect that may be due to the blazingly fast hardware we were running on, where everything is just too blindingly fast to matter (NOT!). You ought to do your own testing on your own platforms if object redraw seems too slow.

### Example

```foxpro
frmForm.ClipControls = .T.
```
