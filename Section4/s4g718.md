## HScrollSmallChange, VScrollSmallChange

These two properties control how much a form scrolls each time you click on one of the arrow keys of a scrollbar. 

### Usage

```foxpro
frmForm.HScrollSmallChange = nHorizontalAmount
nHorizontalAmount = frmForm.HScrollSmallChange
frmForm.VScrollSmallChange = nVerticalAmount
nVerticalAmount = frmForm.VScrollSmallChange
```

Did you ever wonder how applications decided how much to scroll when you use the arrows on the scrollbars? Us neither, but now we know anyway. 

The default for these properties is 10 pixels, but you can set it as high or low as you want. You can even change it dynamically. This seems most appropriate when the amount of information changes dramatically, or if you want to provide the feeling of acceleration on a *really* long form.

Note that only forms have these properties, even though edit boxes, grids and some other controls can have scrollbars, too. Sounds like control discrimination to us.

### Example

```foxpro
ThisForm.HScrollSmallChange = 30
```
