## AllowHeaderSizing, AllowRowSizing

These two grid properties help to give you control over whether users can change the grids you so carefully set up. They determine whether the user can change the size of the header and the size of each row, respectively.

### Usage

```foxpro
grdGrid.AllowHeaderSizing = lLetUserResizeHeader
lLetUserResizeHeader =  grdGrid.AllowHeaderSizing
grdGrid.AllowRowSizing = lLetUserResizeRows
lLetUserResizeRows =  grdGrid.AllowRowSizing
```

All rows in a grid have the same size, so AllowRowSizing indicates whether the user can resize all rows. There's no way to resize a single row. 

The technique for resizing both headers and rows is somewhat restricted. To resize a grid header, you have to position your mouse near the left edge of the grid near the area where the header and the first row meet. The width of the area that gives you a resize cursor is the size of the record mark and delete mark columns, even if you've turned them off. Resizing rows works the same way&mdash;you have to have the mouse in the area where the record mark and delete mark columns belong. In addition, you only get a resize cursor at the bottom of the first visible row. 

### Example

```foxpro
IF This.AllowRowSizing
   WAIT WINDOW "You can make rows bigger or smaller by dragging"
ENDIF
```
