## Reset

The Reset method of the Timer Control resets the Timer to start its countdown from the beginning. 

### Usage

```foxpro
tmrTimer.Reset()
```

A Timer is a built-in FoxPro control that counts down a specified interval of time (cleverly specified by its Interval property) and then performs the code included in the Timer event. Reset causes it to start counting down again from the beginning. The Enabled property determines if the Timer is active. Setting the Interval property to zero also deactivates a Timer&mdash;the Timer event will not fire, even though the Enabled property is .T.

### Example

```foxpro
TIMER1.Reset()
```
