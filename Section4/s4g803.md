## Clear TypeAhead

This command empties out the type-ahead buffer, throwing away any keystrokes the user has entered in advance.

### Usage

```foxpro
CLEAR TYPEAHEAD
```

Once in a while, you have a sensitive input item where you want to be sure the user knows what he's doing. You don't want mindless keyboarding to result in a disaster. When that's the case, you can CLEAR TYPEAHEAD just before entering the field in question. CLEAR TYPEAHEAD just before displaying a WAIT WINDOW, or any WAIT command where you really want some time to pass. CLEAR TYPEAHEAD affects MessageBox() calls as well.
