## NToM(), MToN()

NTOM() and its counterpart, MTON(), convert numeric values to currency and vice versa.

### Usage

```foxpro
nNumeric = MTON( mCurrency )
mCurrency = NTOM( nNumeric )
```

Why the "M" in the function name, rather than a "C" for Currency? Well, "C" is already taken as the type for Character fields, so Microsoft chose "M" because it's one of the few letters that doesn't occur in the word "currency." No, actually, we suspect they chose it as shorthand for "Money." It's not intuitive, however, and violates the rules used to name other conversion functions, such as DTOT(), CTOD(), in that the type abbreviation for currency ("Y") isn't in the function name. Besides, we think that NTOY() and YTON() are cool names for functions.

These functions aren't always required. REPLACE converts one to the other automatically. A literal number can be expressed as currency by preceding it with the $ delimiter. However, if you are performing heavy mathematics like interest calculations, you'll want to convert your currency values to numeric if digits beyond four decimal places are important&mdash;they often are!

### Example

```foxpro
REPLACE mMoneyField with NTOM(nNumerics)
nRatio = MTON(mDollars)/nNumeric
```
