## Sys(0)

SYS(0) returns the machine identification number and the identification of the user, if your network shell supports this functionality.

### Usage

```foxpro
cID = SYS(0)
```

We usually don't depend on this information being available. Single-user installations may not give us useful information. Under some network operating systems, SYS(0) is blank unless specific changes are made to the NOS configurations&mdash;changes our clients may be unwilling or unable to do. Some network shells do not provide this information, causing the function to return SPACE(15)+"#"+SPACE(1). Stand-alone installations (including those that have not started the network shell) return "1". Bottom line: you need to test if this information is available on the specific installation you are working on. In a shrink-wrapped application, or one where you don't configure the client's workstation, count on SYS(0) returning blank information, somewhere, sometime.

### Example

```foxpro
? SYS(0)        && "PROMETHEUS # troche" on Ted's NT machine
? SYS(0)        && "TAMAR'S DELL#Tamar " on Tamar's NT
                && machine
```
