## Quit

This command closes Visual FoxPro. It's equivalent to choosing File-Exit from the main menu or double-clicking on the control menu. 

Some folks use Quit to end their applications. We don't recommend it, because it shuts down FoxPro in the process, something you won't much appreciate when you're testing an app. Use RETURN instead. Reserve QUIT for those times, such as in an error handler when all hell has broken loose, that you really want your user out of FoxPro, and not just out of your app.

### Usage

```foxpro
QUIT
```

QUIT triggers the ON SHUTDOWN routine if there is one. Make sure that routine is available or you won't be able to quit. 

The Help file includes a dire warning about being sure to issue QUIT when you exit VFP. For development mode, it's an excellent warning, but when your users are working in the runtime environment, terminating your application has the same effect, and QUIT is unnecessary.
