## ADataBases()

This function fills an array with the list of open databases. It gives you both the name and the path for each database.

### Usage

```foxpro
nCount = ADATABASES( aDatabaseArray )
```

Like the other array manipulation functions, ADATABASES() returns the number of rows in the array created. Similarly, if there are no open databases, ADATABASES() returns 0 and doesn't create or change (if it already exists) the specified array.

The function does not honor the setting of SET FULLPATH, but we think that's good. No matter what, the second column contains the full path to the database.

### Example

```foxpro
CLOSE DATA ALL        && make sure no databases are open
? ADATABASES(aDbs)    && returns 0
OPEN DATA (_SAMPLES+"TasTrade\Data\TasTrade")
? ADATABASES(aDbs)    && returns 1
```
