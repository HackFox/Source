## ProjectHook

This is the base class for project hooks, which define objects you can attach to a project to let you make things happen while you're working with the project. Every time a project opens, it has the opportunity to create and attach a project hook. 

While project hooks have all the usual properties and methods, like Name, Parent, Tag, ReadMethod, and so forth, everything really interesting about project hooks happens in their event methods.

  <p>Fires when a project's Build method is called (whether it's called through the interface or programmatically). Allows you to both make sure certain things happen before the build and change the nature of the build by changing the parameters passed to Build. NODEFAULT halts the build process.</p>

  <p>Destroy</p>
  </td>
  <td width=75% valign=top>

  </td>
 </tr>
<tr>
  <td width=25% valign=top>
  <p>Init</p>
  </td>
  <td width=75% valign=top>
  <p>Fires when the project is opened. Lets you do things on the way in. One good thing to do here is give the project hook a reference to the project. (Of course, Init fires if you instantiate a project hook without having it attached to a project, too.) One caution here: The ProjectHook instantiates early in the life of the project, so some project methods (like the source code control CheckIn() and CheckOut()) will not work in the ProjectHook.Init method.</p>

Most of these events fire in response to a particular method of the Project COM object. What's most cool is that they fire no matter how that method got called. In VFP 7, three events that don't directly correspond to the Project's method were added: Activate, Deactivate and QueryNewFile.

  <p>Project hooks have methods for the &quot;drop&quot; part of OLE drag and drop, and they fire when something is dragged or dropped over the files portion of the project (that is, the white central area, not the gray borders). We can imagine some pretty cool project hooks that let you do additional processing when files are added to the project by drag and drop.</p>

Except for AfterBuild, these methods all have the power to prevent the specified Project method from actually executing&mdash;issue NoDefault to do so.

  <p>Although you can create project hooks in code (rather than visual) classes, and instantiate and attach those project hooks to open projects, there's no way to make a code class the default project hook for a project. When you try to set ProjectHookLibrary to a PRG, VFP yells at you. You can also run into nasty problems if you have the PRG open while a project is using a class defined within. Since there are no benefits to defining them in code, we suggest you stick with VCX's for project hooks.</p>

### Example

```foxpro

* This simple project hook class simply provides you with
* feedback as you work.
* Set the Include file for the class as FoxPro.H (in the main
* VFP directory) to get access to the project constants used
* in BeforeBuild.
DEFINE CLASS prjShowMe AS projecthook

   Name = "prjShowMe"

   *-- A pointer to the project associated with this project
   *-- hook.
   oProject = .NULL.
