## At_C(), AtCC(), RAtC()

These functions were added in version 3.0b. They perform the same role for double-byte (or mixed) character data that AT(), ATC() and RAT(), respectively, do for single-byte characters. 

### Usage

```foxpro
nFoundPos = AT_C( cString1, cString2 [ , nOccurrence ] )
nFoundPos = ATCC( cString1, cString2 [ , nOccurrence ] )
nFoundPos = RATC( cString1, cString2 [ , nOccurrence ] )
```

We're not equipped to test double-byte characters, so we can't say whether they work in that setting. They do work as expected on single-byte data. 

There's actually a fairly good argument that you should use these functions all the time and forget the single-byte versions. That way, your apps need less work if you need them to operate in a double-byte environment. We haven't actually managed to change our habits yet, but we keep trying to convince ourselves.
