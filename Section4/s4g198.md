## Create Menu, Modify Menu

These two commands open the Menu Designer. They share many of their clauses with other Create/Modify pairs.

### Usage

```foxpro
CREATE | MODIFY MENU [ MenuName | ? ]
        [ WINDOW DefinitionWindow ]
        [ IN [ WINDOW ] ContainerWindow | IN SCREEN
         | IN MACDESKTOP ]
        [ NOWAIT ] [ SAVE ]
```

See Create Form for explanations of the various clauses of these commands.

The Menu Designer creates Windows-type menus, using DEFINE MENU et al. Beginning with VFP 5, it can also be used to create shortcut menus (also known as right-click or context menus).

### Example

```foxpro
CREATE MENU AppMenu
```
