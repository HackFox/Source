## ASort()

This function sorts the elements in an array. You can sort the entire array or a consecutive subset. In a two-dimensional array, sorting can be based on any column. Either ascending or descending order can be specified. Beginning in VFP 7, you can also perform case-insensitive sorts.

### Usage

```foxpro
nSuccess = ASORT( ArrayName [, nStartPos [, nNumElems
                  [, nSortOrder [, nCase ] ] ] ] )
```

In order to specify sort order, you have to provide the starting element and number of elements or rows to sort. Starting element isn't so hard, since it's usually 1, but providing the number of elements is a pain&mdash;ALEN() can be handy here. Fortunately, you can also specify &ndash;1 (or 0 or any other negative number) to indicate all elements.

Similarly, you have to specify the starting element in order to indicate the number of elements or rows to sort. This one makes sense, though, since the two are related.

With two-dimensional arrays, it's a little tricky to specify the starting element sometimes. The key is that it should be the element in the column you want to sort on, in the row where you want to start sorting. Say you have a 5x3 array and you want to sort the first three rows based on the second column. The starting element is 2. If you want to sort the last three rows based on the second column, the starting element is 12. AELEMENT() can give you a hand here.

FoxPro does not perform what's known in math as a "stable sort." In a stable sort, when two items have the same value in the column you're sorting on, they retain the same relative position they had before the sort. So, for example, if you have a two-column array containing last names and first names, a stable sort would allow you to sort them on first name, then on last name, and know they were completely ordered. FoxPro doesn't do this. We suspect it's because unstable sorts are much faster. Use a cursor and index it if you need to sort on multiple columns.

### Example

```foxpro
ADIR( aFiles, "*.DBF")   && Get a list of DBFs
ASORT( aFiles)           && Put in name order
ASORT( aFiles, 1, -1, 1) && Put in descending name order
ASORT( aFiles, 2)        && Put in size order
ASORT( aFiles, 3, 3)     && Put the first 3 rows in date order
ASORT( aFiles, 18, 5)    && Put the 4th through 8th rows
                          && in date order
ADIR( aFiles, "*.DBF", "*.*", 1)  && DBFs with original caps
ASORT( aFiles, -1, -1, -1, 1) && Case-insensitive sort
```
