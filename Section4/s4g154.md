## _StartUp

This system variable lets you specify a program to run when FoxPro starts up. You specify it in the CONFIG.FPW file. 

### Usage

```foxpro
_STARTUP = cProgram
```

This variable was added in FoxPro 2.6 to enable the Catalog Manager to be up and running when FoxPro opened. The specified program is run before a command specified by COMMAND=.

Changes to _STARTUP once FoxPro is running don't have any automatic effects. But because this is a system variable that can't be cleared, it's another hook you can grab to use for your own purposes. See _ASSIST for ideas about how to use these hooks.

### Example

```foxpro
* The next line would appear in CONFIG.FPW.
_STARTUP = MyStart.PRG
```
