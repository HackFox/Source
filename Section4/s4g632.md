## WindowList

Yet another conversion-related property. This one replaces the WITH clause of READ, listing windows that are to be treated as part of the formset even though they're not forms.

### Usage

```foxpro
frsFormSet.WindowList = cListOfAssociatedWindows
cListOfAssociatedWindows = frsFormSet.WindowList
```

Associated windows are relevant only in modal situations. You need to tell FoxPro that some windows are accessible, so the user can touch those even though the current form is modal. For example, you might make the Calculator available during entry of line items. Normally, in a modal READ, only the windows controlled by the READ are accessible.

<table border=0 cellspacing=0 cellpadding=0 width=100%>
<tr>
  <td width=17% valign=top>
<img width=95 height=78 src="bug.gif"></p>
  </td>
  <td width=83%>
  <p>The Converter doesn't get this one quite right. When READ has a WITH clause, it's automatically modal even without the MODAL keyword. Faced with a screen that has a list of associated windows but doesn't have MODAL checked (in the 2.x Project Manager's Edit Screen Set dialog), the Converter copies the list of windows to WindowList, but sets WindowType to 2 rather than 3, the modal choice for READ-type windows.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
</table>

Like the other conversion stuff, this one's relevant only when WindowType is one of the READ compatibility types. It's totally ignored for real VFP forms.

### Example

```foxpro
This.WindowList = "Customers"
```
