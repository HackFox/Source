## ChrTranC(), StuffC()

These are double-byte equivalents of CHRTRAN() and STUFF(), added in version 3.0b. They appear to work, though we've been unable to test substitution of double-byte characters for single-byte and vice versa.

### Usage

```foxpro
cRetVal = CHRTRANC( cSource, cCharsToReplace, cReplacements )
cRetVal = STUFFC( cSource, nWhereToStart, nLong,
                  cReplacementString )
```
